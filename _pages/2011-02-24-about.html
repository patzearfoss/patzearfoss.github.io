<p><strong>About Me</strong></p>
<p>I'm a developer of iOS applications working for <a href="http://www.mindgrub.com">Mindgrub Technologies</a> in Baltimore.  I got my start working with iOS shortly after the 2.0 SDK became public by being the only intern brave enough to raise my hand when the boss asked who wanted to work on our first iPhone Project.  Since then I've worked about a dozen app projects, both large and small.</p>
<p>I enjoy making great-looking apps that offer fantastic user experiences that do things other apps don't do.  I don't always get my wish on that, but I certainly try to learn something new in every app I help produce.</p>
