<p>Most of the iOS controls have the option to tail truncate a string with an ellipsis on the end.  You can even get this same functionality when drawing a string yourself.  However, there doesn't seem to be a way to get the tail truncated version as an NSString.  </p>
<p><a href="http://iOSDeveloperTips.com/" title="[iOS developer:tips]">iOS Developer Tips</a> has a nice little category do get exactly that.  It allows you to specify the width and font used and will return you the truncated version.  Very handy!  The code for it is located <a href="http://iphonedevelopertips.com/cocoa/truncate-an-nsstring-and-append-an-ellipsis-respecting-the-font-size.html" title="Truncate a String and Append an Ellipsis, Respecting the Font Size">here</a>.</p>
