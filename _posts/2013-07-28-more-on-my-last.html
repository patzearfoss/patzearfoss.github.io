<p><a title="Reactive Cocoa Readme" href="https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveViewModel/blob/brief-explanation/README.md">This addition</a> to the <a title="Reactive Cocoa" href="https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa">Reactive Cocoa</a> readme came across my twitter feed this morning. It seems like Reactive Cocoa might bring to life a lot of the ideas I mentioned in my <a title="Lessons from AngularJS" href="http://zearfoss.wordpress.com/2013/07/14/lessons-from-angularjs/">previous post</a>.  The MVVM pattern is certainly interesting.</p>
