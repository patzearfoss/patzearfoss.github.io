<p>I'll be speaking tonight at the Frederick Web Technologies meetup at 7pm.</p>
<p><a href="http://zearfoss.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/logo-wurl-200x160.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-184" title="FWT Logo" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/logo-wurl-200x160.png" alt="" width="200" height="160" /></a></p>
<p>Details are <a href="http://www.meetup.com/FredWebTech/events/23248411/">here on meetup.com</a>, and my <a href="https://github.com/pzearfoss/FWT">sample code</a> as been pushed to GitHub. Â My slides are currently converting on slideshare, let's hope I have more luck with them than I've had in the past.</p>
<p>I'll be talking about introductory iOS development and highlighting some sample code.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT: </strong><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/pzearfoss/frederick-web-meetup-slides">Slides are up!</a></p>
