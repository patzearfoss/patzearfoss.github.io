<p>I don't know how it is I haven't come across <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/209170/how-much-does-it-cost-to-develop-an-iphone-application">this stackoverflow discussion</a> about iPhone app costs before.  </p>
<p>Like most developers, I'm asked frequently to run levels of estimate for software projects at work and in the freelance arena.  Consistently, I feel like there's pressure to give the client a number that they can swallow, which is ordinarily way under what the work is at a quality level I'm comfortable with.  It's a constant battle for me to be honest with myself about the time required to actually complete the work.  After all, everyone loves to get the contract.  </p>
<p>Of course, the downside is, and everyone knows it, that a gross under-bid is bad for everyone.  As the developer, you feel overly constrained to meet unrealistic deadlines, you wind up putting in hours for free or feel like you're not serving your clients as well as you can by delivering a sub-par product.  </p>
<p>The discussion is an excellent read for folks who always find themselves having to place numbers on iOS projects.  It's refreshing to get a peek into the scales of production from the developers of some the most revered apps out there.</p>
