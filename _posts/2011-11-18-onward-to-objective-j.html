<p>I've starting working on a web project that will be built around objective-j and cappuccino, a an objective-c/cocoa style layer above Javascript.  There's some interesting challenges to go along with it, especially as it's a new platform and I'm relatively unfamiliar UIKit's older brother, AppKit.  I'll be posting a lot of about it in the next couple weeks as this project rolls on.  </p>
<p>As a new platform, (good) documentation is pretty scant.  Here's a couple of links where you can learn more and get started.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cappuccino.org" title="Cappuccino Homepage">Cappuccino Homepage</a><br />
<a href="https://github.com/280North/Cappuccino" title="280North on Github">Github repo</a> (don't follow these install instructions, they didn't really work for me).<br />
<a href="http://capptutorials.net/getting-started" title="Capptutorials getting started">THE tutorial that actually helped me get it installed.</a></p>
<p>Much of the install process requires you be at least pretty comfortable on the command line.  Additionally you'll want to create .bash_profile file in your home directory if you don't already have one since there are a couple environment variables the installer will want to create.  Overall the framework looks like it's pretty simple to get rolling for someone like me who's used Javascript in the past but has spent the past couple years in objective-c.  Lot's more to come!</p>
