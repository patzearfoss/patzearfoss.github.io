<p>These are some of the better blogs and authors in my Google Reader related to iOS, Cocoa, and Objective-c:</p>
<p><a href="http://iphonedevelopment.blogspot.com/">"iPhone Development"</a> - Jeff LaMarche : Always well written and in depth articles.  Virtually every article gets starred in Google Reader.<br />
<a href="http://cocoawithlove.com/">"Cocoa with Love"</a> - Matt Gallagher : If you're looking for how to use an obscure part of the apple frameworks, this would be the first place to look.  Usually Matt's posts come with accompanying sample code.<br />
<a href="http://blog.ablepear.com/">"Able Pear Software"</a> : A lot of good beginner articles.  Not updated as frequently as it used to be, but their <a href="https://twitter.com/ablepear">twitter feed</a> has been very active with links to resources.<br />
<a href="http://www.cocoanetics.com/blog/">"Dr. Touch"</a> : Another resource for finding information on lower level or more obscure cocoa tips.<br />
