<p>The developers of <a href="http://www.hipmunk.com">Hipmunk</a> posted <a href="http://blog.hipmunk.com/hipmunk-for-iphone-post-mortem">a recent blog article</a> detailing their post-mortem thoughts on the creation of their iPhone client.  It's a good read top-to-bottom, but I thought the most interesting bit was regarding the performance and data transfer between the Hipmunk servers and the client.  This quote I think sums it up aptly:</p>
<blockquote><p>Parsing large amounts of JSON sucks.</p></blockquote>
<p>I think that can hold true whether you're talking about JSON or XML.  In fact, I find that parsing a given XML feed into business objects eats up a sizable chunk of time on any project.  Their solution was to send <em>compiled</em> plists rather than big chunks of JSON, which cut the import time down by more than an order of magnitude.  Not too shabby.</p>
<p>Compiling a plist server side doesn't seem to be as big of a chore as you'd think.  In fact, there's a <a href="https://github.com/rodneyrehm/CFPropertyList">github project</a> that will do the server side compilation for you.  We have a couple of end-to-end products developed here at <a href="http://www.mindgrub.com">Mindgrub</a> that we're going to look at implementing using compiled plists over the XML we're using now.</p>
