<p>For a recent project I needed to create a table view where items were listed alongside roman numerals.  I surprised that I didn't find any open source component for doing this, so I created <a title="NSNumber+RomanNumerals on GitHub" href="https://github.com/pzearfoss/NSNumber-RomanNumerals" target="_blank">this category</a> on NSNumber that returns its roman numeral value as a string.  Since I translated the code from a .net implementation I found in a tutorial, I figured I may as well contribute it back.</p>
<p>Happy Coding!</p>
