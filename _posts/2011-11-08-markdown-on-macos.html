<p><a href="https://github.com/suminb/readown" title="Readown">Readown</a> is a markdown viewer for MacOS.  I couldn't get it to open .markdown files on my machine after downloading the binary, so I grabbed the source from github and rebuilt for Lion which seemed to solve the issue.  I'm <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10228600/Readown.dmg" title="Readown dmg file">posting it up here</a> thinking it may help someone else.  Cheers!</p>
