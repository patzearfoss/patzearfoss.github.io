<p>I'm by no means a GDB expert.  I know the basics, but I just learned this gem today.  Say you have a C array with five items created with something like this:</p>
<p>[code language="objc"]</p>
<p>int *array = malloc(5 * sizeof(int));</p>
<p>[/code]</p>
<p>And you want to print it out in the debugger quickly.  You can't just print the pointer because GDB doesn't know to print it as an array, but this will:</p>
<p>[code]</p>
<p>p *array@5</p>
<p>[/code]</p>
<p>Output:</p>
<p>[code]</p>
<p>$1 = {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1}</p>
<p>[/code]</p>
<p>To use this the left hand side, before the '@' should be an array, and the right hand side needs to be the length of the array.  Very handy.</p>
