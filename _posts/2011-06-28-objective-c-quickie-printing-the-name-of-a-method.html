<p>Getting the name of a method as a string is quite easy in objective-c. Â This quickie is useful for logging, or in my case raising an exception if the method is not overridden by a subclass:</p>
<p>[code language="objc"]<br />
NSString *methodName = NSStringFromSelector(_cmd);<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>NSStringFromSelector is pretty straightforward, and _cmd is one of the two hidden parameters to every objective-c selector (along with self).</p>
