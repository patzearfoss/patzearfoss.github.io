<p>I occasionally see posts on various website about what it takes to be an intern at a software development company. As <a title="Mindgrub Technologies" href="http://www.mindgrub.com">Mindgrub</a> has grown we've struggled with the same questions ourselves. I'm going to lay out what we look for an intern, what we expect from you, and the kind of work you'd do if you're working for a great software company:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>You've got a background - </strong>You are either coming to us a third or fourth year computer science student or have published work in the Apple or Google Play stores. If you're coming to us from a university you've definitely gotten through the basics and taken at least data structures.</li>
<li><strong>You're independent - </strong>You can work on a task by yourself with minimal guidance. You know where to look for answers to questions (ie. documentation, stackoverflow, good old google), how to ask those questions, and how to understand the answers given there.<span style="line-height:13px;"> You also know how and when to ask for help from your manager.</span></li>
<li><strong>You're detail oriented - </strong>You take pride in writing good, clean code. You never just assume it works. Rather you take the time to ensure the work is done and done properly. You care as much about how what you're working on looks as much as that it completes task. If you were to hand it in for a grade, it would never get just a 'B' from your teacher.</li>
<li><strong>You're perceptive - </strong>You're able to take direct criticism and indirect criticism well. The best interns at Mindgrub are able to feel the pace that we move at and work to match it.</li>
</ol>
<p>What you'll do working for a great software company:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Contributing - </strong>Your thoughts and your ideas will be going into our products. You won't just be testing or supporting full time engineers.</li>
<li><span style="line-height:13px;"><strong>Real Code - </strong>You'll be working on real code that will be delivered to a client or will go in one our apps. Your code will be on someone's device, in someone's hand helping them get work done or entertaining them.<br />
</span></li>
<li><strong>Learning - </strong>You'll be learning tons. Each full timer at Mindgrub learns new things every day. We love doing it and we love seeing what we're able to do progress with every project. You'll learn too and you'll learn right aside us.</li>
<li><strong>Getting Paid - </strong>We don't believe in making people do things for free. You'll get paid to write code (not a ton, but way better than Starbucks).</li>
<li><strong>Be a part of the team - </strong>We don't have, need, or want interns who only get coffee, run tests (though that's important too), or fill out bug reports while the full timers get to make all the cool apps. You'll be just as much a part of the team as everyone else.</li>
</ol>
<p>A great software company will recognize that great interns are an important part of having a great team. Mindgrub is always looking for great interns to <a title="Mindgrub Contact" href="http://www.mindgrub.com/contact">join</a> us.  Could you be one?</p>
