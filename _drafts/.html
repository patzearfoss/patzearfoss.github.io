<p>Most developers are aware of Design Patterns, the definite book by the Gang of Four.  If not they're at least acquainted with the design patterns that are provided for in the Apple frameworks like MVC and observer.  Design patterns enable you to solve similar problems in similar ways without reengineering the entire solution every time.  In contrast there's also a wide array of antipatterns, solutions that are shown not to work.  In the middle, there's a series of patterns that are, well, a little fuzzier.  They work sometimes or they work well to a point. Typified/Modal classes Megalithic View Controllers Mixing Presentation and Content Too Much Abstraction / Convenience Admiral's codebase is nearly two years old.  As you would expect there's been some significant refactorings that have gone on over that time.</p>
